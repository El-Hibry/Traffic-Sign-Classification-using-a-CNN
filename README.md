# Traffic-Sign-Classification-using-a-CNN
This project designs and implements a deep learning model for real-time traffic sign classification. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to classify images from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.
